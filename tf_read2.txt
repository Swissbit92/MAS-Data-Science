Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has downplayed any concerns about a potential attack on the networkâ€™s upcoming ETH upgrade, which sees it shift to a proof of stake consensus design. Yield farming lockups create concerns. After yield farming aggregator Yearn Finance launched its yETH vault earlier this week, the protocol attracted over ETH on the first day itself. The vault pays out yields to those who lock their holdings on the platform from the returns generated by the interest gained on that locked up ETH on different platforms. But Eric Wall, the chief intelligence officer of Arcane Assets, raised concerns around the unusually large amount locked up. He said on a tweet that the yETH vaults can, theoretically, control and launch an unprecedented attack on the Ethereum network due to its sheer size.
